The purpose of this assignment is to parse a CSP XML file and parse it in a readable format. The parser will take in a CSP XML file (done in /src/csp/MyParser.java), parse the data, and format it in a readable way for the user to read. The MyParser.java is considered the driver class, and should be run from this script. The actual parsing is done in (/src/tools/InstanceParser.java), and the formatting is done in the following files: /src/compononets/PConstraint.java, /src/compononets/PDomain.java, /src/compononets/PIntensionConstraint.java, /src/components/PRelation.java, /src/components/PVariable.java. All work done is done by Tomo Bessho in CSCE 421 (2/1/2020)
